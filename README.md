# matrixCalculator with Google Test

This project focuses on learning testing using the Google Test framework and implementing basic matrix operations between two matrices. The main goal is to gain experience writing unit tests and verifying the correctness of matrix operations.

## Project Overview

The project includes the following components:

- `matrix_calculator.hpp` and `matrix_calculator.cpp`: Implementations of basic matrix operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- `main.cpp`: The main program logic that interacts with the user to perform matrix operations.
- `test/CalcTests.cpp`: Unit tests for verifying the correctness of matrix operations using Google Test.

Please note that the Google Test framework is not included in this repository. You can obtain the framework separately from the [Google Test GitHub repository](https://github.com/google/googletest).

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Obtain the Google Test framework from the [Google Test GitHub repository](https://github.com/google/googletest).
3. Build the project according to your build system (e.g., CMake, Makefile).
4. Run the compiled executable to perform matrix operations and see the results.

## With this project, I learn the following:

- Understand the basics of testing and unit testing.
- Learn how to use the Google Test framework for writing unit tests.
- Implement and test basic matrix operations in C++.

Feel free to explore the code, modify it, and make any corrections.

## Contributing

Contributions to this learning project are welcome! Feel free to suggest improvements, add more matrix operations, or enhance the testing suite.
